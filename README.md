# Used Car Dataset

**Project Description**

*The used car sales industry is one of the largest in the world. In the US,  40 million used cars were sold in 2018 alone. However, determining the fair value of a used car can be difficult. Physical features such as the number of years since manufacture, manufacturer, model, and mileage all play a part. For an ecommerce platform selling used cars or insights on used cars, it is important to employ analysts and data scientists to extract patterns from data and help derive insights that could help different aspects of the operation*
